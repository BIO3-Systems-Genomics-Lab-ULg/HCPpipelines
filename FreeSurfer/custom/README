These are scripts that can be used to get better performance out of
FreeSurfer version 6 on high resolution data (with or without a T2
scan). Make sure the directory that these files are in,
${HCPPIPEDIR}/FreeSurfer/custom, is on your PATH before running
FreeSurferPipeline.sh. Run recon-all.v6.hires as you normally would
WITHOUT -hires or -cm but adding -conf2hires.
